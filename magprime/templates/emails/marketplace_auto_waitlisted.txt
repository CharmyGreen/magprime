Hello {{ group.name }}!

Thank you for your interest in MAGFest Marketplace. We've reviewed your application and, unfortunately,
due to the high number of applicants this year, your marketplace application has been waitlisted.

If a marketplace table slot becomes available, you will be notified and given the opportunity to accept
that table. 

We also apologize because we were hoping to get this information out to applicants by Nov 8, 2015, 
but due to a technical configuration error, this email was not sent until now.

We'll be opening applications for the MAGFest 2017 Marketplace in summer 2016, so please try
applying again in the future. Have a great evening!

~ Danielle Pomfrey
Marketplace Coordinator
