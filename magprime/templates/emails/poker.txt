Thanks again for signing up for shifts in tabletop!  We're looking for a little extra help running some of our poker tournaments this year; they've been so popular in the past that we could use a few more people to help run them.

If you're interested in doing this instead of (or in addition to) some of your existing shifts, please reply to this email and let us know.

- Devon Courtwright,
Tabletop Organizer
