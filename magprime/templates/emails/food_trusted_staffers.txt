Dear Returning Trusted Volunteers,

It's good to see you again, and I'm glad you are coming back. This is going to be a big year for us. We will have the full Chef crew back aboard with Chef and Mrs. Chef back after taking last year off to have the Chefling. Yes you can meet him, if you are good.

While writing this I am reminded of the letter that I wrote for the first time volunteers, telling them of the need for obedience, intelligence, dilligence and respect. Know that if you are reading this letter then several things have happened. First is that you have shown the qualities listed above, which is a rare thing. Second is that at least two of the senior staff have submitted your name, and vouched for you personally. I hope that you understand the level of trust that this represents.

I could give you a long and involved letter like I did for the newbies, but with you I am going to skip that and tell it like it is. You are some of the best people I have had the honor to serve with. I know you are able and willing. I know that you have it in you to keep the pace. But now I am going to ask something more of you, I am going to ask you to help keep an eye on the newbies, help us to make this the {{ EVENT_NAME }} best yet. 

If you need anything, please ask, and if you see anything, please tell me. 

- Chef
