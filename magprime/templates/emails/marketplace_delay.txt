Good Evening {{ group.name }}!

First, I must apologize for the delays in getting you your responses about the MAGFest Marketplace. Sadly, I suffered a loss in my family, and then my day job went off the rails, so I am very sorry for the delay. But, all marketplace application decisions will be delivered by 11:59pm, Sunday, November 8th. It is important to note emails will go out in waves and will be a combination of approvals, waitlists, and declines. So, if you see people posting about getting in, and you haven't heard back yet, then don't panic because we will get to you. There are almost 350 of you, so it will take time to get all the announcements out. I hope all of you are well, and it has been my great pleasure to see so many awesome applications this year. Have a great evening!
