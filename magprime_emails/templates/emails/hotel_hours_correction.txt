Apologies for the mostly-duplicated email.  Due to an oversight, our previous email about your MAGFest hours indicated that people working setup/teardown do not need to sign up for shifts in advance, but this is NOT true this year.  Even people who plan to work all of their hours helping with setup/teardown must still sign up for shifts in advance.

As the previous email stated, you're receiving space in one of our volunteer hotel rooms, which has a requirement of 30 weighted volunteer hours, and you're currently only signed up for {{ attendee.weighted_hours }} hours.

You can log in to sign up for shifts at {{ URL_BASE }}/signups/login

Sorry again for the confusion, and please let us know if you have any questions.
