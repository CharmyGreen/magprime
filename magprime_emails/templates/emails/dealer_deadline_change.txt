Our apologies for the delays in communication regarding your MAGFest 13 (January 2015) marketplace application status.  We received an immense number of applications this year immediately after opening them up, so many that we had to shut down submissions after only three days!  It's been a record breaking year for us, and unfortunately that means it has taken us far longer than originally anticipated to make our final decisions on our marketplace applications.

We understand that arrangements must be made in advance for your journey to MAGFest, should your application be accepted, so we understand the need for you to be informed of your status as soon as possible.  We sincerely apologize for the delay in application processing, and rest assured that you will receive a final decision on your application no later than Sunday, October 19, 2015.  Whether you are accepted, waitlisted, or declined, you will receive en email from us.

We appreciate your understanding in this matter, and again apologize profusely for the delay.  We have just wanted to make sure every application gets the thorough review it deserves.  Thank you and have a great day!

- Danielle Pomfrey,
Marketplace Coordinator 
and the rest of the Marketplace Team
