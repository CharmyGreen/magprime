{% endif %}Thanks so much for helping run MAGFest 8.5 last year, we couldn't have pulled it off without so much help from our wonderful volunteers.  We're making it a yearly thing, it's now called {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and this year it's happening {{ c.EPOCH|datetime:"%b %e" }} - {{ c.ESCHATON|datetime:"%e" }}!  As thanks for your help last time, you're eligible for a complementary {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Staff badge, which you can accept by visiting {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}

After you accept your Staff badge, you'll be emailed when shifts become available.  Also, as a proven staffer, you'll also be eligible for complementary crash space in one of our staffer hotel rooms.  You'll be emailed closer to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} with details about how to sign up for this.

If you want to come to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} but don't want to volunteer again, just let us know and we'll swap your Staff badge for a complementary Attendee badge as thanks for the hard work you put in last time.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
